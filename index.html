                <p>Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually
                and uses cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating authority,
                instead using a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.</p>
                <div id="test">Cryptocurrency comes under many names. You have probably read about some of the most popular types of cryptocurrencies
                such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Cryptocurrencies are increasingly popular alternatives for online payments.
                Before converting real dollars, euros, pounds, or other traditional currencies into â‚¿ (the symbol for Bitcoin, the most
                popular cryptocurrency), you should understand what cryptocurrencies are, what the risks are in using cryptocurrencies,
                and how to protect your investment.
                
                What is cryptocurrency? A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using
                encryption algorithms. The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency and as
                a virtual accounting system. To use cryptocurrencies, you need a cryptocurrency wallet. These wallets can be software
                that is a cloud-based service or is stored on your computer or on your mobile device. The wallets are the tool through
                which you store your encryption keys that confirm your identity and link to your cryptocurrency.</div>
